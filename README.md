# Prediction of Consumer Behaviour using Machine Learning

## Background
This project aims to address issues of unnecessary spending, environmental waste, and cluttered living spaces by developing a smart, interactive system. The system helps users reflect on their purchase behavior through:
- Prediction of customer purchase intentions
- Identification of trending product categories
- Humorous AI-generated messages to encourage thoughtful purchasing decisions

## Problem Statement
Consumer purchases are increasingly influenced by viral trends and social media hype, leading to impulsive buying decisions driven by popularity rather than personal need. This often results in:
- Unnecessary spending
- Environmental waste
- Cluttered living spaces
- Products that are rarely used

## Objectives
1. Build and evaluate machine learning models to predict customer purchase intention
2. Detect trending items based on purchase category and frequency
3. Develop a web application dashboard featuring:
   - User intention prediction
   - Trending items display
   - Integration with generative AI for humorous messaging

## Scope of Study
The project focuses on analyzing consumer behavior patterns and developing predictive models to help users make more informed purchasing decisions.
